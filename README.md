# **End Cancer - Data Visualization Project using Tableau**

## **Project Overview**

The **End Cancer - Data Visualization Project** uses Tableau to present and analyze cancer-related data, providing insights into cancer incidence rates, mortality rates, survival rates, and demographic trends. This project aims to highlight key patterns and disparities in cancer data to support public health strategies and research efforts.

---

## **Data Sources**

The project leverages publicly available cancer data, including:

- **Cancer Incidence Rates**
- **Cancer Mortality Rates**
- **Survival Rates**
- **Cancer Demographics (Age, Gender, Region)**
- **Types of Cancer**

---

## **Project Goals**

- Visualize and explore cancer data through interactive dashboards.
- Analyze trends in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival over time.
- Identify regional and demographic differences in cancer impact.
- Provide insights to inform public health initiatives and research.
